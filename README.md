# rich-codex ⚡️📖⚡️

A command-line tool and GitHub Action to generate screengrab images of a terminal window containing code snippets or outputs from commands.

It can be configured in three different ways:

- [Markdown comments](#markdown-comments): Searches for special HTML comments in your markdown files
- [Action inputs](#action-inputs): Specify a command or snippet using the action `with` inputs
- [Config files](#yaml-config-files): Use one or more YAML config files for multiple images and more complex customisation

Once the action generates images, it's up to you to use them however you like.
Some examples can be found in the [Complete examples](#complete-examples) section below.

## Markdown comments

```yaml
rich_codex:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: ewels/rich-codex@v1
```

### Auto-generate and push

This action looks for rich-codex markdown comments, generates the images and then creates and pushes a new commit with the changes.

```yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  rich_codex:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Generate code images
      uses: ewels/rich-codex@v1

    - name: Add and commit new images
      uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9
      with:
        message: Generate new screengrabs with rich-codex
        committer_name: GitHub Actions
        committer_email: actions@github.com
```

## How it works

Rich-codex uses the Python library [rich](https://github.com/textualize/rich) and also the command line tool [rich-cli](https://github.com/textualize/rich-cli/) under the hood.
These do all of the heavy lifting of actually creating the images.

Rich-codex is a simple wrapper that loads commands/snippets from various places, collects command outputs and then passes this to rich.
This command-line tool should really only be used in the context of the GitHub action, to auto-generate images from inline configs.
The [rich-cli](https://github.com/textualize/rich-cli/) tool is better for basically all other uses.
